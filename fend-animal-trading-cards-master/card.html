			<h3 class= "header paragraph">The Siberian Husky in a few words</h3>
			<p class= "paragraph color">The Siberian Husky originated in northeastern Siberia and was bred by the Chukchi Eskimos of northeastern Asia to pull heavy loads long distances across rough terrain in difficult conditions. Huskies were also used to herd reindeer and as watchdogs. After arriving in Alaska during the Nome Gold Rush, Huskies began appearing throughout the U.S. and Canada. Also known as the Chukcha or Chuksha dog, and nicknamed the Husky or Sibe, the Siberian Husky belongs to the Spitz family of dogs. Today's Husky is primarily a pet or show dog.</p>
